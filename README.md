# Poimote 
NOT READY FOR GENERAL PUBLIC USE

#### Description:
A webUI / API for sending pre-defined SSH commands to computers. This assumes that the computer hosting this app already has SSH key pairs setup between it and any other computer to which it would send commands.

#### Intstallation:
Will be automated as a package in the future. In the meantime you can navigate to this folder, run the following command:
```py
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
and in your terminal run:
```py
flask run # Add "--hosts=0.0.0.0" If you want the web app to be accessible on the whole network.
```
